# Alamo

This project was developed with Angular v18. I am using Material UI as default library, Ionicons is also used for special icons like 
the GitHub icon in the top right corner of the page.

## Folder structure

The structure of this project is based on features with a feature folder group all available features. Then we have a shared folder 
which is responsible for components in common like toolbar or footer.
